 A component in a `Workflow`; should be independent of the workflow context.
 
 ### Discussion
 It's important to make sure your `FlowRepresentable` is not dependent on other `FlowRepresentable`s.
 It's okay to specify that a certain kind of data needs to be passed in and passed out, but keep your `FlowRepresentable` from knowing what came before, or what's likely to come after.
 In that way you'll end up with pieces of a workflow that can be moved or put into multiple places with ease.

 - Important: Declare an **input** type of `Never` when the `FlowRepresentable` will ignore data passed in from the `Workflow`.  An **output** type of `Never` means data will not be passed forward.
 - Important: A `_workflowPointer` has to be declared as a property on the type conforming to `FlowRepresentable` but it is set by the `Workflow`, and should not be set by anything else.
 - Important: If you create a superclass that is a `FlowRepresentable` and expect subclasses to be able to define their own methods, such as `shouldLoad`, the superclass should declare those methods, and the subclasses should override them. Otherwise you will find the subclasses do not behave as expected.

 #### Example
 A `FlowRepresentable` with a `WorkflowInput` of `String` and a `WorkflowOutput` of `Never`
 ```swift
 class FR1: FlowRepresentable { // Mark this class as `final` to avoid the required keyword on init
    weak var _workflowPointer: AnyFlowRepresentable?
    required init(with name: String) { }
 }
 ```

 A `FlowRepresentable` with a `WorkflowInput` of `Never` and a `WorkflowOutput` of `Never`
 ```swift
 final class FR1: FlowRepresentable { // Classes synthesize an empty initializer already, you are good!
    weak var _workflowPointer: AnyFlowRepresentable?
 }
 ```

 #### Note
 Declaring your own custom initializer can result in a compiler error with an unfriendly message
 ```swift
 class FR1: FlowRepresentable { // Results in compiler error for 'init()' being unavailable
    weak var _workflowPointer: AnyFlowRepresentable?
    init(myCustomInitializer property: Int) { }
    // required init() { } // declare your own init() to satisfy the protocol requirements and handle the compiler error
 }
 ```

public protocol FlowRepresentable {
    /// The type of data coming into the `FlowRepresentable`; defaulted to `Never`; `Never`means the `FlowRepresentable` will ignore data passed in from the `Workflow`.
    associatedtype WorkflowInput = Never
    /// The type of data passed forward from the `FlowRepresentable`; defaulted to `Never`; `Never` means data will not be passed forward.
    associatedtype WorkflowOutput = Never

    /**
     A pointer to the `AnyFlowRepresentable` that erases this `FlowRepresentable`; will automatically be set.

     ### Discussion
     This property is automatically set by a `Workflow`, it simply needs to be declared on a `FlowRepresentable`.
     In order for a `FlowRepresentable` to have access to the `Workflow` that launched it, store the closures for proceeding forward and backward, and provide type safety, it needs this property available for writing.

     #### Note
     While not strictly necessary it would be wise to declare this property as `weak`.

     ### Discussion
     This method is called *after* `init` but *before* any other lifecycle events. It is non-mutating and should not change the `FlowRepresentable`.

     - Important: If you create a superclass that is a `FlowRepresentable` and expect subclasses to define their own `shouldLoad` the superclass should declare `shouldLoad`, and the subclasses should override it. Otherwise you will find the subclasses do not behave as expected.

     #### Note
     Returning `false` can have different behaviors depending on the `FlowPersistence`.
